// Default security policy file.
// On startup, BootStrap reads environment and adds additional permissions
// for configured paths and network binding to these.

//// SecurityManager impl:
//// Must have all permissions to properly perform access checks

grant codeBase "${codebase.securesm-1.0.jar}" {
  permission java.security.AllPermission;
};

//// Very special jar permissions:
//// These are dangerous permissions that we don't want to grant to everything.

grant codeBase "${codebase.lucene-core-5.5.2.jar}" {
  // needed to allow MMapDirectory's "unmap hack" (die unmap hack, die)
  permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "accessClassInPackage.sun.misc";
  permission java.lang.reflect.ReflectPermission "suppressAccessChecks";
};

grant codeBase "${codebase.jsr166e-1.1.0.jar}" {
  // needed for LongAdder etc
  // TODO: remove this in java 8!
  permission java.lang.reflect.ReflectPermission "suppressAccessChecks";
  permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "accessClassInPackage.sun.misc";
};

//// Everything else:

grant {

  // third party code, to safeguard these against unprivileged code like scripts.

  // (this logic is more strict than the JDK, see SecureSM)
  permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "modifyThread";
  permission java.lang.RuntimePermission "modifyThreadGroup";
